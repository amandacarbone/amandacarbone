I am a software developer and aspiring red teamer catalyzed by a lifelong affinity for technology and its infinite power to positively transform the lives of others. In an era where most individuals have transcended the mundane into cyberspace and rely on technology for more critical purposes beyond pure novelty, it is my passion to not only develop more intuitive, accessible, and secure digital experiences for my fellow cyber citizens, but also to help them understand their acting environments and explore them safely and responsibly.

I am a graduate of the Frontend Development Bootcamp at Grand Circus - Detroit. There I received intensive, hands-on education in software development from a frontend perspective learning React, JavaScript, TypeScript, and HTML/CSS while also being taught to work with full-stack technologies including Express, SQL, and REST APIs. While presently employed as a frontend developer, I am also enrolled in the Cybersecurity Professional program at Nexus - University of Michigan Engineering receiving training in network/cloud security, Microsoft/Linux security, CIT, ethical hacking/penetration testing, DFIR and threat hunting.

A natural inclination towards calculated meticulousness, structure, logic, and efficiency - plus an affinity for technology and its virtually infinite potential to progress humanity in so many ways - is what catalyzed me to deepen my knowledge of coding and ultimately decide to transition to the role of full-stack developer.

I spent 7+ years in digital content marketing specializing in copy writing, content strategy, and SEO in B2B and B2C settings. During this time, I worked closely with web and software developers from conception to deployment, providing strategic insight to best support user experience. This enables me to offer technical skill tempered with an agile, team-oriented mindset and an acumen for developing websites and apps that support an accessible, comprehensible user journey while aligning with business goals.

I am a front-end developer completing the Front-End Development Bootcamp at Grand Circus.

Prior to Grand Circus, I spent 7+ years in digital content marketing in both B2B and B2C settings where I had the opportunity to collaborate directly with development teams and cultivate an understanding of their complete workflow including wireframing, UX, and testing.

It was during this time that I realized the crucial importance of intuitive, accessible, and secure digital experiences to supporting user journeys, especially in an era where most individuals have transcended the real world into cyberspace and have come to rely on technology for higher reasons including information, communication, and even personal well-being. It is this infinite potential to improve the lives of others that drew me to software development.

At Grand Circus, I have received intensive, hands-on training from a front-end perspective learning React, JavaScript, TypeScript, and HTML/CSS having built a mobile-responsive POS system and soon a live web application from scratch. Outside of that, I am driven by a borderline Faustian obsession with expanding my coding knowledge and experience; most notably taking additional courses in Python and volunteering my skills on a project developing an application to improve the vetting process for veterinarians, breeders, and shelters of animal adoption or purchase applicants.

I am thrilled to begin my career as a developer and look forward to harnessing the power of technology to positively impact the world through user-centric applications.

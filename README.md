Frontend developer, avid gamer, hockey fanatic, and unrelenting nerd who enjoys a good meme, a good stream, and jaunty electronic music.

As a graduate of the Frontend Development bootcamp at Grand Circus - Detroit, not only did I receive rigorous, hands-on education from a frontend perspective in React, JavaScript, and TypeScript, but also full-stack technologies including REST APIs, Express, Node, and SQL. I am also proud to say that I maintained near perfect grades being among the top of my cohort, and received frequent honors and commendations from staff and students for my UI/UX design, conceptual creativity, and problem-solving abilities.

My background in digital content marketing and current role in software development exclusively within remote startup/small business environments has required me to cultivate strong agile workflow, time management, accountability, and self-starting skills. Moreover, having worked on small, tight-knit teams in which I have frequently taken on leadership responsibilities, I also bring valuable listening, motivational, judgement, and task delegation qualities.

Outside of my professional life, I am driven by a relentless hunger for expanding my knowledge and experience with various technical concepts to increase the value I bring to my career. Most notably, building two React Native apps with a small team of former classmates planned for consumer availability, as well as spending much of my free time building clones of popular apps.
